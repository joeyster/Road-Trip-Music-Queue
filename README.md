# wavester.io
## Inspiration
One day on a 12 man bus with 11 friends heading to Las Vegas, we were listening to music. 
"Can you play this?"
"Can you play that? Oh! And also that."
"Pass me the phone, let me queue somethin' up too"
Can you picture this imagery in your head?
What if they can just go on their own phones and queue it up themselves? wavester.io is here to solve that problem =)
