# wavester.io
## Pronunciation (very important! I paid extra for .io... please)
wave â€¢ stereo

## Inspiration
One day on a 12 man bus with 11 friends heading to Las Vegas, we were listening to music. <br>
"Can you play this?"<br>
"Can you play that? Oh! And also that."<br>
"Pass me the phone, let me queue somethin' up too"<br>
Can you picture this imagery in your head?<br>
What if they can just go on their own phones and queue it up themselves? wavester.io is here to solve that problem =)

## What it does
wavester.io lets users create a "private room" and have other users join that room to queue up music.<br>
Users queue up music by adding tracks to the host user's Spotify playlist. Host user will have the options to clear the playlist, or the makeshift queue, at any point in time.

## How I built it
wavester.io was built with ReactJS and Express, using Javascript as its primary language.

## Set up
need to download nodejs
* `npm install npm -g`
* `npm install create-react-app -g`
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
  * needs to be in the directory where `node_module` is in
